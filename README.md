# Familiar
## D&D Character Managment App

### Description

Familar is a support app for the popular dungeons and dragons 5th edition role playing game. Often the most difficult part of playing dungeons and dragons for news and experienced players is keeping track of all the rules and stats for your characters. This app seeks to make that experience as easy and streamlined as possible so the player can have a fun and fully immersive role playing experience.


### Motivation

While other apps aim to achieve similar goals, most are tied to the original character sheet and dice role model. This app seeks to move to a card based system making the expereince feel as tangible as possible. When a player wants to perform an action the player simply selects the action card they wish to play and all the character stats and dice roles needed for the action will be made automatically. A move that traditionally takes minutes now takes seconds, and with no math or rule checking required!
