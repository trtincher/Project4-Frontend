## D&D Character Managment App

### Description

Familar is a support app for the popular dungeons and dragons 5th edition role playing game. Often the most difficult part of playing dungeons and dragons for news and experienced players is keeping track of all the rules and stats for your characters. This app seeks to make that experience as easy and streamlined as possible so the player can have a fun and fully immersive role playing experience.


### Motivation

While other apps aim to achieve similar goals, most are tied to the original character sheet and dice role model. This app seeks to move to a card based system making the expereince feel as tangible as possible. When a player wants to perform an action the player simply selects the action card they wish to play and all the character stats and dice roles needed for the action will be made automatically. A move that traditionally takes minutes now takes seconds, and with no math or rule checking required!

### Demo

#### Dashboard Layout:
Here you have three main sections: the header, the footer, and the body. The header holds all or your main character stats that you will always need to be able to access. The footer holds your general dice roll button, your health display, and your edit health buttons. Finally the body holds your "decks". The decks represent a genre of actions or attributes.<br/>

Clicking on a skill wil active the autoroll feature. To use a skill you need to roll a 20 sided die and add your proficency bonus if needed. Just by clicking on the skill card the roll and nessisary additions are all done for you. This way all you have to do is tell the game master the bolded number. No searching for dice or math required?<br/>

When the play button is selected the damage card appears. This uses the autoroll feature to determine the damage. Here again all nessisary modifiers are auto added based on your characters states.<br/>
